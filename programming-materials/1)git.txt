If your source code is in the different directory, you need to change the directory on git bash with command cd followed by directory or path.

cd - To change the directory

git init- This command initializes the git in the given path. You can see the .git hidden files after this command gets executed.

git remote add origin [gitLink]- gitLink denote the place where your code is stored in the remote repository

git add .- Add all the files in the local directory to the remote repository

git commit -m "First commit"- It establishes a connection with local repository

git push origin master- It establishes a connection with a remote repository and upload your source code or files to GitHub

Note: If you get fatal: remote origin already exists which means the connection is already established.

1) Navigate to the local project directory and create a local git repository:

 git init

2) Once that is successful, click on the 'Source Control' icon on the left navbar in VS-Code.One should be able to see files ready to be commit-ed. Press on 'Commit' button, provide comments, stage the changes and commit the files. Alternatively you can run from CLI

git commit -m "Your comment"
3) Now you need to visit your GitHub account and create a new Repository. Exclude creating 'README.md', '.gitIgnore' files. Also do not add any License to the repo. Sometimes these settings cause issue while pushing in.

4) Copy the link to this newly created GitHub Repository.

5) Come back to the terminal in VS-CODE and type these commands in succession:

git remote add origin [Link to GitHub Repo>]     //maps the remote repo link to local git repo

git remote -v                                  //this is to verify the link to the remote repo 

git push -u origin master                      // pushes the commit-ed changes into the remo
